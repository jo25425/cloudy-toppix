# cloudy-toppix
Urgh.

## Instructions

Download the whole repository and put it in the website directory of a local web server (e.g. xampp/htdocs for XAMPP). Then open [http://127.0.0.1/cloudy-toppix/index.html](http://127.0.0.1/cloudy-toppix/index.html) in a (non-ancient) browser.

## Notes

- I wasn't sure what *popular* meant exactly in *Each topic should have one of 6 different text sizes, with the most popular topics largest, and least popular smallest*, so I assumed - judging from the page mockup - that it referred to the number of mentions of each topic.
- The computer used to code this isn't the newest/healthiest, so I didn't install any additional browsers for testing. This application has only been tested in the latest Chrome (although I'd definitely expect it to work in some other browsers too).
- There could have been a topic model and collection, but I decided that it wasn't justifiable given the simpleness of this application. It would be an obvious addition for anything requiring more complex manipulations of topic data.
- For similar reasons, the panel and chart don't have their own views.

## Ideas
- Get require.js involved.
- Fancy "woosh" sound on topic hover.
- More interesting conclusions/observations using topic metadata!
- Possibility to click and select multiple topics to view cool comparison charts in another panel.
